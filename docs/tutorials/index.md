# Tutorials

These tutorials introduce a few fundamental concepts in deep learning and how to implement them in _MXNet_. The _Basics_ section contains tutorials on manipulating arrays, building networks, loading/preprocessing data, etc. The _Training and Inference_ section talks about implementing Linear Regression, training a Handwritten digit classifier using MLP and CNN, running inferences using a pre-trained model, and lastly, efficiently training a large scale image classifier.
